Bassed on CLT Theory

Currently the lamina all have to be of the samme material and thickness

In the MainFile.py input the materail properties of your lamina, the fiber angle. The amount of fiber angles represnets the amount of layers.

In NM array input the Forces or moments acting on the laminate. From there the script does the rest and calculats the LSM matrix, ABD matrix, strains and stresses.

Numpy & pandas are needed inorder to run the scripts

I am running: 
Python 3.7.3
Numpy 1.16.4
Pandas 0.24.2
